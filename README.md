# Github Search

This Rails application demonstrates the use of Faraday and Github API. This application provides users with a simple query form to make a search on Github. The application then uses the query string and makes an API request to Github, receives JSON response, parses the response, and displays the response to the user in a user-friendly style.  

## Usage
This is a simple, intuitive app. Simply type your search string, and hit the "Search" button.
The result will be displayed in the same page.
